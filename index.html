                    Eubuleus is a TTRPG (Tabletop Roleplaying Game) created by MangoChaton to bring the fun, interactive experience of games like Dungeons & Dragons to a completely different, unusual setting, that combines the genres of Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Cyberpunk into one. The story as you see it is how events unfold in the game itself, which is acted out by MangoChaton and his friends.

Nothing matters, other than the fact they have magic.
